8. URL building
    * build urls using URL reversing method url_for, it takes 2 params, 1-function name, 2-args taken by function
    * change urls in one go instead of changing the hardcoded values at multiple places
    * if application is placed outside root, then url_for() takes care of adding the required 

    ex : with app.test_request_context():
            print(url_for('wish', event='service anniversary'))

        output : /wish/service%20anniversary
